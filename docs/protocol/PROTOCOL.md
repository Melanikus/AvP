# How AVPx Dedicated Server talks

Written 2026-11-08 by Melanikus. This is the whole of what the server says and hears, in any language it's written in. Change it only together with the code and its tests, and say why here.

**Changed 2026-11-08:** one list and a relay in each region, so the game plays well from Brazil, Europe and the Middle East. New: the round-trip message (`ECHO`), the pass that lets the list check a room on another machine, the relays' directory (`GET /v1/relays`), and the listing's region, level number, game style, co-op state and host's round trip. The protocol is as it was written at 7014de1; the code matches it from the commit after.

AVPx Dedicated Server is one program, and every machine runs the same code. Its settings say which parts a machine runs:

- **a relay,** over UDP, one in each region: it carries each game's packets between the host and every joiner. It's needed because many players can't be reached from the internet at all (carrier-grade NAT), and the game's network library, ENet, speaks only UDP.
- **the list,** over HTTPS, one for everyone: hosts put their games on it, and players read it to pick a game. The list runs on one of the relay machines.

The first relays are on AWS Lightsail: **`saopaulo`** (sa-east-1), **`virginia`** (us-east-1) and **`paris`** (eu-west-3). The list is on the `virginia` machine. A relay can be added (Tel Aviv, say) by starting one more machine and adding it to the list's settings; no game needs changing.

Everything that arrives is treated as hostile (AVP Tao 3). Every field has a written size, and anything not exactly as written here is dropped. No IP address is ever written to a log or a file (the user's ruling: "no IPs"). Everything the list shows is open for anyone to read, and it holds no personal data: no address, no player's name, nothing but what a host typed as its game's name.

## 1. A game's life, start to end

1. **The host picks a relay.** Its game reads the relays from `GET /v1/relays`, and measures its round trip to each with `ECHO` (section 2, Round trips). It takes the relay with the lowest time.
2. **The host asks that relay for a room.** From its game's own UDP socket, it sends `HOST_OPEN` to the relay's control port.
   - The relay answers with a `COOKIE` (section 3, Cookies).
   - The host asks again with the cookie. The relay answers `HOST_OPENED`, with the host's **token** (16 random bytes, the host's proof to the relay from then on), the game's **code** (8 letters), and a **pass** (section 3, Passes: the host's proof to the list that the room is real).
3. **The host puts the game on the list.** It sends `POST /v1/games` over HTTPS, with the relay's region, the code, the pass, and what the game is. The list answers with an **owner** key (16 random bytes, the host's proof to the list from then on).
4. **The host keeps the room, and the listing.** Every 15 s, from the same socket, it sends `HOST_KEEP` with its token. That keeps its NAT's door to the relay open and the room alive, and the relay's `HOST_KEPT` answer carries a fresh pass. Every 15 s too, the host sends `PUT /v1/games` with its owner key and the newest pass. That keeps its listing alive. The list and the relay may be on different machines, so each has its own keepalive.
5. **A player picks the game** from `GET /v1/games`, which says each game's relay region. Its game looks that region up in `GET /v1/relays`. A player who types a code instead: its game asks every relay, and only the one with that room answers `JOIN_PORT` (the rest answer `REFUSED`, reason 1).
6. **The joiner asks that relay to join.** It sends `JOIN` with the code to the control port, and gets a cookie first, as the host did.
   - The relay answers `JOIN_PORT`: a **ticket** (16 random bytes, the joiner's proof) and a relay port of its own for this joiner.
   - The same `JOIN` again, from the same address and port, before that port is claimed (step 7), gets the same port and ticket again, never a second port: the joiner's game asks each second until it hears, so its first `JOIN_PORT` was lost.
7. **The joiner says hello on that port, and claims it.** It sends `JOINER_HELLO` with its ticket, from its game's own socket, at once and then every half second.
   - **Only then** does the relay tell the host `NEW_JOINER`, with that port, and count the joiner as one of the room's players. Until the host has said hello there, it tells the host again at most once a second, in case a `NEW_JOINER` was lost.
   - The host says `HOST_HELLO` with its token on that port. The two hellos fix, for the relay, where each one's packets come from through its NAT.
   - A `JOIN` that's never followed by its joiner's hello holds nothing for long (section 6 says why): its port is freed 5 s after `JOIN_PORT`, it isn't one of the room's players, and the host never hears of it.
8. **When both have said hello,** the relay sends `READY` to the joiner. The joiner's game starts its ENet connection to that relay port. The relay then passes every packet between the two, unread and unchanged.
9. **The end.** A joiner's port is freed after 30 s with no packets, 5 s after `JOIN_PORT` if the joiner hasn't claimed it, or 15 s after `JOIN_PORT` if the host hasn't said hello. The room ends on `HOST_CLOSE` with its token, or after 45 s with no `HOST_KEEP`; all its joiners' ports go with it. The listing ends on `DELETE /v1/games` with its owner key, or after 45 s with no good `PUT`. A host that closes its game does both.

**The game's own packets have no header added.** The relay port they come in on says which room and which joiner they're for. So the game's ENet packets are never changed, and the host's ENet sees each joiner as a peer of its own, because each comes from a relay port of its own.

## 2. The relay's messages (UDP)

Every message is exactly **64 bytes**, questions and answers alike, so the relay never answers with more than it was sent (no amplification). All numbers are little-endian.

| Bytes | Field | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| 0-3 | magic | `AVPR` (0x41 0x56 0x50 0x52) |
| 4 | version | 1 |
| 5 | type | one of the table below |
| 6-7 | reserved | 0 |
| 8-23 | secret | a token, a ticket, a cookie, or an echo's 16 bytes |
| 24-31 | code | 8 code letters |
| 32-33 | port | a relay port |
| 34-35 | number | a reason or a count |
| 36-51 | pass | a pass (section 3, Passes) |
| 52-59 | pass time | when the pass was made: whole seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC |
| 60-63 | padding | 0 |

**Every field a type doesn't use (a blank in the table below) is 0.**

**Code letters:** `23456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ`. That's 32 of them, with no 0, 1, I or O, so a code can be read aloud. A code is 8 of them, 40 bits.

**Not a message, and dropped:** not exactly 64 bytes; another magic or version; an unknown type; a reserved or padding byte not 0; a field its type doesn't use not 0; a code that's neither all code letters nor all 0; a pass time past 9,007,199,254,740,991 (2^53 - 1, the most a JSON number holds exactly; added 2026-11-08 as a fix, since the code and test-vectors/relay-v1.json already refused it).

| Type | Name | From, to | Secret | Code | Port | Number | Pass and pass time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | HOST_OPEN | host to control | cookie, or 0 the first time | | | | |
| 2 | HOST_OPENED | relay to host | token | the game's | | | a fresh pass |
| 3 | HOST_KEEP | host to control | token | | | | |
| 4 | HOST_KEPT | relay to host | token | | | joiners now | a fresh pass |
| 5 | HOST_CLOSE | host to control | token | | | | |
| 6 | JOIN | joiner to control | cookie, or 0 the first time | the game's | | | |
| 7 | JOIN_PORT | relay to joiner | ticket | the game's | the joiner's relay port | | |
| 8 | NEW_JOINER | relay to host | token | | the joiner's relay port | | |
| 9 | HOST_HELLO | host to the joiner's port | token | | that port | | |
| 10 | JOINER_HELLO | joiner to its port | ticket | | | | |
| 11 | READY | relay, from the port, to the joiner | ticket | | that port | | |
| 12 | REFUSED | relay to the asker | | | | why: 1 no such game, 2 game full, 3 relay busy, 4 too many games from this address | |
| 13 | COOKIE | relay to the asker | the cookie | | | | |
| 14 | ECHO | anyone to control | 16 bytes the asker chose | | | the asker's count | |
| 15 | ECHO_BACK | relay to the asker | the same 16 bytes | | | the same count | |

**What happens to other packets:**
- The relay answers only the types a game sends it (1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 14). Any other type sent to it is dropped.
- On a joiner's port, any packet from its bound host or joiner that isn't a hello is game traffic, and is passed on.
- On a joiner's port, a hello from a new address with the right secret moves that end there: its NAT gave it a new port.
- Anything from anyone else is dropped.
- A game packet is at most 1,500 bytes; a bigger one is dropped.

### Round trips: choosing a relay

`ECHO` asks a relay to answer at once, so the asker can time the round trip.
- **The answer:** `ECHO_BACK`, with the asker's 16 bytes and count unchanged, sent from the control port to the address and port the `ECHO` came from, and nowhere else.
- **Its size:** 64 bytes in, 64 out, never bigger.
- **No cookie:** the relay keeps nothing for an echo, so nobody can make it hold anything with one.
- **Its limits:** an echo is a control message, so it counts in the same per-address and everyone limits as the rest (section 5). An echo over a limit gets no answer at all, not a `REFUSED`.
- **Two types, not one:** the answer is a different type from the question, and a relay drops any `ECHO_BACK` sent to it. So nobody can set two relays answering each other for ever, by sending one an echo with the other's address on it.

**How the game uses it:**
- **The host,** before it opens a room: it sends 3 echoes to every relay in `GET /v1/relays`, 100 ms apart, each with 16 fresh random bytes. It drops any answer whose bytes aren't ones it sent. It takes each relay's lowest time, leaves out a relay that hasn't answered within a second, and opens its room on the relay with the lowest time. It lists that time as `hostMs`.
- **A joiner,** for the games it shows: it measures its own time to each relay the same way, once a relay, not once a game. A game's **estimated ping** is the joiner's time to that game's relay plus the game's `hostMs`, because every packet goes from the host to the relay to the joiner. A game with `hostMs` 0 (not measured) shows only the joiner's own time.
- **This version picks the relay nearest the host.** The relay best for the whole group comes later (section 6).

## 3. Cookies and passes

### Cookies

A UDP sender can put anyone's address on its packets. So the two asks that make the relay keep something, `HOST_OPEN` and `JOIN`, must carry a cookie.
- **What a cookie is:** an HMAC-SHA-256 of the asker's address and port and a 10-second time slot, with a key only this run of the relay has, cut to 16 bytes.
- **How it's handed out:** the relay sends it to that address. Only someone who gets packets there can know it.
- **How long it's good for:** the slot it was made in and the next one, so 10 to 20 s.
- **What the relay keeps to check one:** nothing. It makes the cookie again. Its key changes every 24 hours.

### Passes

The list and a room's relay may be on different machines, in different countries. A pass is how the list knows a room is real without ever talking to the relay: no connection between the machines, and no port open between them.
- **What a pass is:** an HMAC-SHA-256, with the relay's **pass key**, of these bytes one after another: the 11 ASCII letters `AVPX-PASS-1`, the relay's region name in ASCII, one 0 byte, the room's code (8 bytes), and the pass time (8 bytes, little-endian). Cut to its first 16 bytes.
- **Who has the key:** each relay has its own, 32 random bytes, in its settings. The list's settings hold every relay's key. No key is in the repository.
- **How it's handed out:** the relay puts a fresh pass in every `HOST_OPENED` and `HOST_KEPT`, to the room's host only. A host that keeps its room every 15 s always has a pass less than 15 s old.
- **How the list checks one:** it makes the pass again from the region, code and pass time sent with it, and the key of the relay with that region. It's good for 60 s after its pass time. One whose pass time is more than 5 s ahead of the list's own clock is refused. The machines' clocks are kept to network time (NTP).
- **What a pass can't do:** it lets a host list one room, for a minute. It can't end a room, or open one, or reach a relay. A relay's pass key makes passes and nothing else, so a relay machine broken into could make passes only for its own region, and nothing at all on another relay.

## 4. The list (HTTPS)

Every call is HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or newer, and the server sends HSTS. The server listens on HTTPS only: getting the certificate (Let's Encrypt, through certbot) is that tool's own job, on the machine. JSON in and out, UTF-8, and only the fields named here; any other field, or one out of range, gets `400`.

| Call | Body | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/relays` | none | `200 {"relays": [{"region", "host", "port"}]}`, at most 16 relays |
| `GET /v1/relay-keys?region=R` | none | `200 {"region", "p384", "mlkem"}`: a version 2 relay's static public keys (CRYPTO.md section 12.1); `400` for any other query, or a body; `404` if the list has no version 2 relay in that region; `405` for any other method |
| `POST /v1/games` | `{"region", "code", "pass", "passTime", "name", "level", "mode", "gameStyle", "levelNumber", "coopLobby", "players", "maxPlayers", "version", "fingerprint", "hostMs"}`, with `fingerprint` for a version-2 game and only for one | `201 {"owner"}`; `403` for a pass that isn't good; `409` if that game is listed already; `503` if the list is full |
| `PUT /v1/games` | `{"owner"}` and all of POST's fields | `204`, no body; `403` for a pass that isn't good, the wrong owner, or a fingerprint other than the one it was listed with; `404` if that game isn't listed |
| `DELETE /v1/games` | `{"region", "code", "owner"}` | `204`, no body; `403` for the wrong owner; `404` if that game isn't listed. The room itself stays until its host closes it, or stops keeping it. |
| `GET /v1/games?version=N` | none | `200 {"games": [{"region", "code", "name", "level", "mode", "gameStyle", "levelNumber", "coopLobby", "players", "maxPlayers", "version", "fingerprint", "hostMs", "seconds"}]}`, with `fingerprint` exactly on a version-2 game's row; at most 100 games, newest first |
| `GET /v1/games?version=N&code=C` | none | the same, with only the games of that version whose code is `C`, one a region at most: how a game finds a code someone typed. `200` with no games if there are none |

A game is known to the list by its region and code together: two relays could, rarely, make the same code.

Any other status, and every `{"error"}` answer, means the call didn't work. The error's words are for the server's own tests and are never shown to a player: they come from the network.

**Fields:**
- **region:** 1 to 16 characters, small letters, digits and `-`, one of the regions in `GET /v1/relays`. In `GET /v1/relay-keys`, everything after `region=` is checked as one, so `&`, `%`, a space or a capital letter there is `400`.
- **p384:** a relay's static P-384 key, 194 hex digits, small letters: the 97-byte point, 0x04 then X and Y.
- **mlkem:** a relay's static ML-KEM-1024 encapsulation key, 3,136 hex digits, small letters: its 1,568 bytes. The game holds the two keys to the relay's id it already has, 96 hex digits, and uses neither if they don't match (CRYPTO.md section 12.1).
- **host:** a relay's DNS name, 1 to 63 characters, letters, digits, `-` and `.`. A name, never an address, so a relay can move to another machine without a game update.
- **port:** a relay's control port, 1 to 65535.
- **code:** 8 code letters (section 2).
- **pass:** 32 hex digits, small letters, from the newest `HOST_OPENED` or `HOST_KEPT` (section 3, Passes).
- **passTime:** a whole number, 0 to 9,007,199,254,740,991 (the most a JSON number holds exactly), from that same message.
- **owner:** 32 hex digits, small letters, from the `POST`'s answer. It travels only over HTTPS, between the list and the host.
- **name:** 1 to 32 characters, printable ASCII (0x20 to 0x7E). The only text a player types that the list shows.
- **level:** the level's name, 1 to 39 characters, the same letters. 39 is the longest the game's own level names go (`kLevelNameSize` - 1, networking.h).
- **mode:** the game style's name, for people to read, 1 to 32 characters, the same letters.
- **gameStyle:** the game's style number (the game's `NGT_` numbers), 0 to 255.
- **levelNumber:** 0 to 99 for a stock level, 100 for a custom one, which the game then finds by `level`.
- **coopLobby:** the game's co-op lobby state (coop_lobby.h), 0 to 255. With `gameStyle`, `levelNumber` and `level`, it's how a joiner's game picks the level it will load, which on a LAN comes from the session search.
- **players and maxPlayers:** whole numbers, 1 to 8, with players no more than maxPlayers.
- **version:** a whole number, 1 to 65535, the game's network version. A **version-2 game** is one whose network version is the first that speaks handshake B (CRYPTO.md section 8) or a newer one. The list's code names that first version once (`FIRST_V2_VERSION`, Requests.java), and the game names the same number. A game asks only for games of its own version, so an older game never sees a version-2 row.
- **fingerprint:** 32 hex digits, small letters: the fingerprint of the host's identity for this run (CRYPTO.md section 8), which a joiner checks in handshake B. A version-2 game must give it, and an older game can't (`400`). It stays the same for the listing's life: a host that starts again makes a new listing. Nothing secret.
  **Changing (decided 2026-11-09, CRYPTO.md section 8):** this field becomes `id`, the host's whole id, 96 hex digits, small letters, in POST, PUT and GET alike, because the joiner's game compares it, and a machine compares the whole digest. Until that change is built, it's the fingerprint, as written here, and SERVER-BLOCKERS.md item 6 keeps every tester off.
- **hostMs:** the host's round trip to its relay, in milliseconds, 1 to 9999; 0 if it wasn't measured (section 2, Round trips).
- **seconds:** how long the game has been listed, 0 to 31,536,000 (a year); a game listed longer still says a year.

**What a reader can hold the answer to:**
- **Its size:** an answer to `GET /v1/games` is at most 48 KB. The worst case, 100 version-2 games (each with a fingerprint) with every text at its longest and made of the characters JSON writes as two, and every number at its longest, is 46,011 bytes; `&code=` answers less. With `id` in place of `fingerprint` (above), each version-2 row has 55 more bytes (64 more hex digits, and 9 fewer in the field's name), so the worst case becomes 51,511 bytes and the cap 56 KB: the list's own test counts it again from the code when it changes. An answer to `GET /v1/relays` is at most 4 KB (worst case, 16 relays: 1,868 bytes), and one to `GET /v1/relay-keys` at most 4 KB too (worst case, a 16-character region: 3,380 bytes). A reader can refuse anything bigger.
- **Its escapes:** every text is printable ASCII, and for those JSON writes only two escapes, `\"` and `\\`. A reader can refuse any other escape (`\u`, `\n`, `\/` and the rest). The server's tests check both of these.

**Heartbeat and expiry:** a listing lives 45 s after its last good `POST` or `PUT`. A host `PUT`s every 15 s with its newest pass. A pass is good for 60 s, so a listing outlives its room by at most 105 s, and a joiner who tries it meanwhile gets `REFUSED` (reason 1).

**The list never holds an address.** A joiner gets only the region and the code, and joins through that region's relay.

**How a request is read** (added 2026-11-08 as a fix, so that every server that speaks this, in any language, refuses exactly the same requests; nothing an honest game sends is refused):
- **One request a connection.** Every answer says `Connection: close`, and the connection closes after it.
- **A body comes with one `Content-Length`.** A request with `Transfer-Encoding` gets `400`, and so does one with two `Content-Length`s. Headers over 8 KB get `431`.
- **A body is JSON, held to less than JSON allows:**
  - one object, with JSON's whitespace (space, tab, CR, LF) between its parts;
  - its values are strings or whole numbers, with no object or list inside it, and no `true`, `false` or `null`;
  - every byte of a string is printable ASCII, and its only escapes are `\"` and `\\`;
  - a number is `0`, or 1 to 16 digits with no leading `0`, at most 9,007,199,254,740,991, with no sign, fraction or exponent (`1.0`, `1e0`, `-1` and `01` are all refused);
  - no key appears twice. Readers differ on which of two keys counts, and two programs that read one body two ways can be made to disagree about what it said;
  - no key is `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype`. Those name parts of every JavaScript object, and a reader that wrote them into one could change how every other object behaves. No field here has those names, so every server refuses them, in any language (added 2026-11-09 as a fix, from a CodeQL finding). The Java server's words for it are "a field named __proto__, constructor or prototype, which name a part of every JavaScript object"; as with every refusal, the words are for the server's own tests, and never shown to a player.

  Anything else gets `400`.

### Asking to play: access requests (version 2)

A version 2 relay takes approved players only (CRYPTO.md section 6). A player asks to be approved from the game, by pressing
**Request access**. Nothing is ever sent without that press. The owner approves by the access code the player gives him (below).
Agreed 2026-11-09 by Fourth (the game), Primary (the server) and Third.

| Call | Body | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/access-requests` | `{"v": 1, "name", "key"}` | `200 {"v": 1, "fp", "state"}`; `400 {"v": 1, "error"}` with `name`, `key` or `shape`; `429` with `busy`; `503` with `closed` |

**Fields:**
- **v:** the layout's version, 1.
- **name:** what the player chose; the game fills in their profile's name, which they can change. 1 to 15 bytes, each 32 to 126 but
  not `"` or `\` (so the name never needs an escape), and no space at either end. The list shows it only to the owner.
- **key:** the player's identity, its public halves only, exactly as the game keeps them: the P-384 key (97 bytes, 0x04 then X then
  Y), then the ML-KEM-1024 encapsulation key (1,568). These are 1,665 bytes, written in standard base64 with no line breaks: always
  exactly 2,220 characters, with no `=`.
- **fp:** the fingerprint the list worked out from `key` (CRYPTO.md section 8), 32 hex digits, small letters. The list never takes a
  fingerprint it's given. The game checks the answer's `fp` is its own, and treats it as no answer if not: that catches a list and a
  game that work it out differently. It proves nothing about who answered: the access code does that (below).
- **state:** `waiting`, `approved`, `refused` or `revoked`.

**What the list checks,** before it keeps anything:
- exactly these fields, and every size;
- the P-384 key on the curve and not the point at infinity;
- the ML-KEM key passing FIPS 203's encapsulation key check.

**What the list keeps,** for each key: its id (CRYPTO.md section 8, the whole SHA-384, 96 hex digits), its fingerprint (the id's first
32), the name, the state, and when it was first asked. Not the key itself: the relay compares A1's `s` by its id, so nothing needs the
key again, and the store is about 20 times smaller. No address is kept, and the log has counts only, never a name, key, id or
fingerprint. One program writes the store: the list itself. The owner's approvals reach it as
decision files, which it reads as hostile input like any request.

**The owner's decisions** are files in the store's folder, named `decisions.` and a number. Each line is a fingerprint, a space,
and `approved`, `refused`, `revoked` or `forgotten`; the last line is `end` and how many lines came before it, so a file read while
it's still being written is refused whole, never applied in part. The lines are applied in order, all of them or none, at the
list's next turn (about a second), and then the file is deleted. The same moves are checked again there, and a file with a move the
states don't allow (below) is refused whole.

**Asking again** is the same call, from **Check again**. There's no other call, so nobody can look up another player's state by their
fingerprint:
- a key already waiting or approved isn't a new request: the list keeps the name it had first, and answers with the state;
- a key whose fingerprint is a record's but whose id isn't is refused (`400` with `key`), so a fingerprint, and the access code made
  from it, names one record only;
- a key refused stays so, unless the owner forgets it: then it may ask again, as a new request;
- a key revoked stays so. To ask again, the player makes a new identity.

**The states move only so:** waiting to approved or refused, approved to revoked. The owner may also forget a waiting or refused
request: its record goes, so it no longer counts against the limits below, and that key may ask again. Never an approved one (it's
revoked, which also ends its sessions), and never a revoked one (a key taken back stays so). A waiting request is forgotten after 30
days anyway.

**The access code**, shown in the game and never sent: the fingerprint's first 80 bits, read as one number with the highest byte first,
cut into sixteen 5-bit pieces from the top, each written as a letter of `23456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ` (section 2's code letters),
in four groups of four with dashes between, like `ABCD-EF23-4567-89GH`. The player gives it to the owner directly, by a way the owner
knows is them. The owner's approval takes the code, in either case, with dashes and spaces left out, and refuses unless exactly one
waiting request has it. When more than one has it, it shows every one. To get a key swapped in the middle approved, someone would
have to find a key whose code is the real one's (an 80-bit second preimage), and keep the real request from ever arriving: one more
request with the same code, such as the player's own **Check again**, stops the approval and shows the owner both.

**Why the code, and not the list's answer, is what protects a request:** the list's HTTPS is checked by Windows, with no pin of the
game's own (CRYPTO.md section 12.1). A certificate wrongly given out for the list's name could let someone in the middle put another
key in a request, and answer the game as the list would. But that key makes another code, so the code the player gives the owner
matches no waiting request of it, and it's never approved.

**The limits** (section 5 says how they're kept):
- this call's body is at most 4,096 bytes, and its answer at most 512; every other call keeps the 1,024-byte limit;
- one request a minute from one address, and 10 an hour;
- a **new** request (a key the list doesn't have) 5 a day from one address, and 10 a day from one network: an IPv4 address's first 24
  bits, or an IPv6 address's first 48. Asking again about a key the list has costs only the minute and hour limits. The day is the
  address hasher's (section 5): its secret changes every 24 hours, and every count starts again with it;
- at most 1,000 requests waiting;
- **`busy`:** a limit was reached, so try again later;
- **`closed`:** the list takes no requests at all (its settings give it no store).

## 5. The abuse limits

Every number is a starting point, written in one place in the code, and changed only with a reason here.

| What | Limit |
|---|---|
| A UDP packet to the relay | 1,500 bytes at most; a control message exactly 64 |
| Control messages from one address, echoes among them | 10 a second, 20 at once |
| Control messages from everyone, echoes among them | 2,000 a second, 4,000 at once |
| `REFUSED` answers to one address | 1 a second, 2 at once |
| Rooms on one relay | 500 in all; 2 for one address |
| Joiners in one room | 8, counting the ports their joiners have claimed (said hello on) |
| Joins to one room | 4 a second, 8 at once |
| Hellos with the right secret on one joiner's port | 20 a second, 40 at once; one with a wrong secret is dropped before this is spent (section 6) |
| Joiners' ports for one address | 2 at once not yet claimed (one more `JOIN` gets no answer, and the joiner's game asks again a second later); 8 at once in all, claimed or not (one more gets `REFUSED`, reason 3) |
| Game traffic on one joiner's port, each way | 400 packets a second (800 at once), and 256 KB a second (512 KB at once) |
| A joiner's port not claimed by its joiner's hello | 5 s after `JOIN_PORT` |
| A joiner's port waiting for its host's hello | 15 s after `JOIN_PORT` |
| A joiner's port with no traffic | 30 s |
| A room with no `HOST_KEEP` | 45 s |
| A pass | good 60 s after its pass time; refused if its pass time is more than 5 s ahead |
| Listings | 2,000 in all |
| A listing with no good `POST` or `PUT` | 45 s |
| Relays the list names | 16 |
| Addresses the per-address limits remember | 10,000; the one heard from longest ago is forgotten first. For the access call's limits, an address is forgotten only once its count has come all the way back: until then a new address gets `busy`, so a crowd of more than 10,000 can't start each address afresh |
| An HTTPS request | headers 8 KB, body 1 KB; 5 s to send the headers and 5 s for the body |
| HTTPS connections | 200 at once in all, 10 from one address |
| HTTPS requests from one address | 5 a second, 20 at once; `GET /v1/games`, `GET /v1/relays` and `GET /v1/relay-keys` 1 a second, 5 at once |
| HTTPS requests from everyone | 500 a second, 1,000 at once (in the code from the start; added to this table 2026-11-08 as a fix) |
| An HTTPS connection's TLS handshake | 5 s |

**How addresses are told apart without keeping them:** a per-address limit keys by an HMAC-SHA-256 of the address, with a random key that changes every 24 hours and is never written anywhere. The address itself lives in memory only while a room or a port needs it.

**The log:** once a minute, counts and times only:
- rooms opened, closed and expired;
- joins and refusals;
- echoes answered;
- listings made, ended and expired, and passes refused;
- relay keys given, and asked for but not found;
- packets and bytes passed on;
- drops by reason;
- rooms and ports in use.

Never an address, a code, a token, a ticket, a pass, an owner key or a name.

## 6. Known limits of this version

- **Neither the relay's UDP messages nor the game's own packets are encrypted.** Someone on the path between a player and the relay can read and change them, as with playing by typed IP today. A later version could sign the hellos with a key handed over the list's HTTPS.
- **A pass seen on the path can be used by whoever saw it,** for its minute, to list that room before its host does. It can't change or take down a listing already there: that needs the owner key, which travels only over HTTPS. This goes when the relay's messages are encrypted.
- **The host picks the relay nearest itself,** not the one best for the whole group. Picking for the group comes later.
- **A typed code is asked of every relay,** because the code alone doesn't say which relay has the room.
- **What a listing says is the host's word.** Its name, players, level and round trip are shown to players and used to pick a level, never trusted for anything else.
- **Every game goes through a relay.** Hole punching, a direct path when both players' NATs allow it, comes later, with the relay as the fallback.
- **IPv4 only, as the game's ENet is.**
- **Anyone can join a listed game, because the list shows every code.** That's what a public list is for. Two things follow, fixed on 2026-11-09 after the independent review (AvP-docs/engine/review-server-Reviewer.md, V1-1 and V1-2):
  - **A `JOIN` alone holds nothing for long.** Before, a `JOIN` held a player's place and a port for 15 s, so one address sending one `JOIN` every 2 s could keep a room full forever, and a few could take every port. Now the place is taken only when the joiner's hello claims the port; an unclaimed port goes after 5 s; and an address may have only 2 unclaimed at once.
  - **A hello's secret is checked before anything is spent on it.** Before, a stranger who knew a joiner's port could send hellos with wrong secrets and use up the port's hellos, so the real ones were dropped. Now a hello with a wrong secret is dropped at once, and spends nothing. The real ones are held only to their own limit, which nothing else uses.
  - **Why the hellos on a joiner's port have no limit for each address:** an address on a UDP packet can be anyone's. A limit for each address would let someone who puts a real player's address on its packets use up that player's limit, and keep them out, which is the very thing the limit is for. And it would cost the relay a hash of the address for every packet, more than the check of the secret it would guard.
  - **What's left:** someone who reads a code, joins, *and* says the joiner's hello is a joiner as far as the relay can tell. The host's game answers its hello by itself, so it holds a player's place until its port has no traffic for 30 s, and can join again. One address can hold at most 8 places at once in all, so keeping a room full takes at least one address, and keeping many takes many. Only the host's game can tell a real player from one that never plays. A host could close such a game and open another, whose code is new; telling the relay which joiner to drop is a later change.
  - **One address for many players:** behind carrier-grade NAT, many homes share one address. Their players can still join, but at most 8 of them at once on one relay, and at most 2 at once can be between their `JOIN` and their hello. The numbers are a starting point, to change with what the running relays show.
- **A `COOKIE` or `ECHO_BACK` goes to whatever address a packet says it's from,** and a UDP sender can put anyone's there, so the relay can be made to send them to someone who never asked. It's never more than was sent (64 bytes for 64), and everything the control port sends in all is held to 2,000 a second (section 5), so it can't be used to multiply anyone's traffic. A cookie has to go to the address it's for; that's how it proves the address. (The independent review's note, 2026-11-09.)
- **An error nobody expected stops the whole server** (V1-3). If something throws out of a turn of the relay's loop or of the list's timers, the server writes one line saying what kind of error, and where, but never its words, and stops with 1. systemd starts it again 5 s later, with no limit on how often (deploy/avpx-java.service). Every room on it ends, and every host and joiner must start again. That's the price of never carrying on from tables nobody can vouch for. Before, such an error ended the relay's thread alone, and the server looked up while it passed no games.

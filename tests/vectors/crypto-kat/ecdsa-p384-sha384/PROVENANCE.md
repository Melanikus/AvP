# Where the ECDSA on P-384 with SHA-384 cases come from

**The standard:** FIPS 186-4 (ECDSA); IEEE P1363 (the r || s form CRYPTO.md section 12 sends).

Fetched by PO, 2026-11-09 at about 03:00 UTC, each into a folder of its own, and checked here against PO's list of SHA-256s (all 36 matched).
Nothing in a case was changed: each was only written out in this folder's JSON shape (../README.md), with hex in small letters. java/tools/MakeCryptoKat.java makes the files, from the sources put in crypto-kat-sources/ beside the repository's top folder, after checking each one's SHA-256 against the ones below. Run again on them, it makes these files byte for byte.

**Checked when first made (2026-11-09):** 310 classical cases, each redone with OpenSSL (through Node's crypto), 0 wrong. That check was a one-off script and isn't in the repository; the readers' own tests are the check from now on.

# Known answers for protocol version 2's primitives

**What this is:** the published test cases for every primitive CRYPTO.md section 2 names, from the people who wrote each standard.
- **AES-256-GCM**, with a 12-byte IV and a 16-byte tag;
- **HKDF-SHA-384**, with **HMAC-SHA-384** under it;
- **ECDH on P-384**;
- **ECDSA on P-384** with SHA-384, the signature as r then s;
- **ML-KEM-1024**;
- **ML-DSA-87**, pure, with a context.

**Why:** our own tests and our own code can share a mistake, and then every test passes on a primitive that's wrong. A known answer
from NIST, or from Wycheproof's set of edge cases, can't share it. The server and the game both check their primitives against these
files.

**Where they're from:** each folder's PROVENANCE.md names, for every file, the source and its URL, the commit or release, the
SHA-256 and size of the file it came from, its licence, and exactly which cases were taken. In short:

| Folder | NIST | Wycheproof |
|---|---|---|
| aes-256-gcm | CAVP gcmEncryptExtIV256, gcmDecrypt256 | aes_gcm_test |
| hkdf-sha384 | ACVP KDA-HKDF (SP 800-56C rev 2), and RFC 5869's own cases | hkdf_sha384_test |
| hmac-sha384 | | hmac_sha384_test |
| ecdh-p384 | CAVP KAS ECC CDH, and 186-4 PKV | ecdh_secp384r1_ecpoint_test, ecdh_secp384r1_test |
| ecdsa-p384-sha384 | CAVP 186-4 SigVer and SigGen | ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384_p1363_test |
| ml-kem-1024 | ACVP keyGen and encapDecap (FIPS 203) | mlkem_1024 (four files) |
| ml-dsa-87 | ACVP keyGen, sigVer and sigGen (FIPS 204) | mldsa_87_verify_test |

## The shape of every file

```
{ "primitive": "...", "source": "...", "about": "what each case means, and what was taken", "count": N,
  "cases": [ { "id": "...", <the case's inputs and answers>, "result": "valid" } ] }
```

- **Bytes** are hex in small letters, and `""` when there are none.
- **Numbers** are whole numbers.
- **`result`:**
  - `"valid"` means the answer must come out exactly as given;
  - `"invalid"` means it must be refused;
  - `"acceptable"`, in Wycheproof's ECDH only, means either is allowed. Those cases are compressed points, which v2 never sends, so
    v2 refuses them.
- **No `true`, `false` or `null`.** Every string is printable ASCII, with no escape but `\"` and `\\`. So the servers' strict JSON
  reader takes these as they are.
- **Wycheproof's flags** are one string, split by commas (`"Normal,EmptySalt"`), and its comments are kept to printable ASCII.
- **Each file's `about`** says what its fields are and what each `result` means.

## How they were made, and what was checked

- **`java/tools/MakeCryptoKat.java` makes them.**
  - It reads the fetched files from `crypto-kat-sources/` **beside** the repository's top folder (`../crypto-kat-sources`), laid out as
    PROVENANCE.md names them. It's kept outside on purpose, so neither git nor CheckStandard (which reads every file inside) sees it.
  - It checks every source's SHA-256 against its own pinned list before it writes anything.
  - It writes each case's bytes out as the source has them, and changes nothing but how they're written. Anything that isn't as it
    expects stops it, rather than being guessed at.
  - Run on the same sources, it makes these files again byte for byte. That was checked: it remade every one of the 24 exactly.
  - To run it: build with `JAVA_HOME=<the JDK> sh java/build.sh`, then, from the top folder,
    `"$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" -cp java/build/tools avpx.tools.MakeCryptoKat`.
- **Every classical case was checked against OpenSSL, through Node's crypto, when they were first made (2026-11-09):** 2,316 in all,
  with 0 wrong. That check was a one-off script and isn't in the repository: it's kept here, and in each PROVENANCE.md, as evidence.
  The one case not checked is a single "acceptable" ECDH one, where either answer is right. What was checked:
  - every AES-256-GCM case seals to its ct and tag, and every "invalid" one fails to open;
  - every HKDF case gives its okm, all 100 of ACVP's included (so the rule that turns them into plain HKDF is right), and every
    "invalid" size is refused;
  - every HMAC tag is right, or wrong as marked;
  - every ECDH case gives its shared secret, and every "invalid" point is refused;
  - every ECDSA signature checks or fails as marked.
- **ML-KEM and ML-DSA were checked for their sizes only** (FIPS 203 and 204's). Whether they compute right is what each reader's own
  tests prove against them, with two independent sources for each.

## What a reader does with them

- The **server** (Java, Primary) and the **game** (Fifth) each read the folders they need.
- A reader runs every case, and fails if:
  - a "valid" one doesn't give exactly its answer;
  - an "invalid" one isn't refused.
- A case a primitive can't take, such as a key form an API won't import, is counted and named in the test's output, never left out
  silently.
